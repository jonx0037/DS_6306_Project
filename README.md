# Crab Age Prediction Project

This repository contains the code and analysis for DS_6306 Project 2, focusing on predicting crab age based on physical attributes.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a regression model that accurately predicts the age of crabs based on their physical characteristics. The project has two main objectives:

1. **Objective A**: Build a regression model to predict crab age with the lowest possible Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
2. **Objective B**: Analyze the data to uncover key factors or relationships that contribute to predicting crab ages.

## Data Description

The dataset contains measurements of various crab physical attributes and their corresponding ages. The input variables include:

- Sex
- Length
- Diameter
- Height
- Weight
- Shucked Weight
- Viscera Weight
- Shell Weight

The target variable is Age.

## Running the Code

### Prerequisites

The following R packages are required to run the code:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "caret", "randomForest", "xgboost", "e1071", 
                  "corrplot", "gridExtra", "ggpubr", "recipes", "vip", 
                  "doParallel", "shiny", "shinydashboard", "shinythemes", 
                  "plotly", "DT", "knitr", "kableExtra"))
```

### Execution Order

The scripts should be run in the following order:

1. `01_data_cleaning.R` - Cleans and preprocesses the data
2. `02_exploratory_analysis.R` - Performs exploratory data analysis
3. `03_feature_engineering.R` - Creates new features and selects important ones
4. `04_model_training.R` - Trains and evaluates multiple models
5. `05_model_prediction.R` - Generates predictions for the competition data
6. `06_shiny_dashboard.R` - Launches the interactive dashboard

### Running the RShiny Dashboard

To run the RShiny dashboard, execute the following command in R:

```r
shiny::runApp("scripts/06_shiny_dashboard.R")
```

## Analysis Report

The analysis report can be generated by knitting the R Markdown file in the `reports` directory:

```r
rmarkdown::render("reports/analysis_report.Rmd")
```
